          I am Olena from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Art has always been a part of my life—from a happy
          childhood, where the first strokes on paper opened up an endless world of creativity, to
          today, when art has become not only a form of self-expression but also a way to help
          others.
          <br />
          However, my life’s path took a different course for a long time. I dedicated seven years
          to serving in the Ukrainian police, working as a company commander and a press officer.
          This job required strength, resilience, and discipline. But life is unpredictable then the
          war in Ukraine began, I was on maternity leave and was forced to leave my homeland with my
          children.
          <br />
          Upon arriving in the UK, I found a new way to be of service—through art. Volunteering at
          art classes created a space where people could find comfort, experience the joy of
          creativity, and relieve the stress of difficult times. I happily shared my knowledge,
          using various painting techniques that helped people cope with challenges and discover new
          facets of themselves.
          <br />
          Today, my art is no longer just a hobby but a way of serving people in a creative form. I
          believe that creativity has the power to heal, inspire, and unite and I continue to pour a
          piece of myself into every painting I create.
