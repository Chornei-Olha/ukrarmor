          I am Olena, an artist from Ukraine. My work is shaped by lived experience, inner
          discipline, and a quiet sense of presence.
          <br /> <br />
          Before fully devoting myself to art, I spent years in public service — a path that formed
          my inner structure, resilience, and composure. When life required profound change, art
          became a way to remain upright, grounded, and deeply attentive to meaning.
          <br /> <br />
          Today, my practice explores posture beyond the physical — an inner alignment, a calm
          authority, a state of being. Each work carries restraint, emotional depth, and subtle
          strength.
          <br /> <br />
          This is art for those who recognise elegance in stillness, meaning in presence, and
          strength in quiet form.
